gde2-desktop
=============

gde2-desktop contains the libgde2-desktop library, the gde2-about
program as well as some desktop-wide documents.

The libgde2-desktop library provides API shared by several applications
on the desktop, but that cannot live in the platform for various
reasons. There is no API or ABI guarantee, although we are doing our
best to provide stability. Documentation for the API is available with
gtk-doc.

The gde2-about program helps find which version of GDE2 is installed.

You may download updates to the package from:

   http://pub.gde2-desktop.org/releases/


Installation
============

If you are not using a released version of gde2-desktop (for example,
if you checked out the code from git), you first need to run
'./autogen.sh'.
